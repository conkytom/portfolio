My current professional career is in brewing.   In three and a half years I went from a lowly packaging line assistant to lead brewer of a thriving craft beer production facility, managing a team of 17 brewers and production staff while coordinating the incoming ingredients, the outgoing product, and all the steps in between.

While transitioning to programming is a big change, I know that I can bring the same strong work ethic, dynamic coordination skills, and effective team management know-how that I have developed to my new professional industry.
