## Explanation

This simple, but incredibly helpful, application was created to help users utilize the power of the [Pomodoro Technique](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique), a time management [life hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_hack) designed to break up a person's work into intense, but manageable 25 minute increments with breaks in between to unwind and clear the mind.

## Problem

Working intensely on any task can be very draining as life is always managing to offer plenty of distractions, especially in the modern world of constantly being connected.  Transitioning one's focus from their main task to answering emails can disrupt a person's workflow.  At the same time, concentrating too intensely on a single problem for too long can cause fatigue and lead to mistakes. The pomodoro technique aids in alleviating these problems.

## Solution

The Pomodoro Technique is pretty simple.  It sets up a timer to designate 25 minutes to focus on a given task, this is called a Pomodoro.  During those 25 minutes that task should be the **only** thing that is worked on.  After a Pomodoro there is a 5 minute break to breathe, step back from the project, answer some emails, or grab another coffee.  After 4 Pomodoros there is a longer break of 15 or 30 minutes.  This is a good time to grab a meal or handle another smaller task that might take more time.

## Results

This minimalist app provides the user with a simple countdown timer that dings after 25 minutes(one Pomodoro), and then provides them with a 5 minute break.  After 4 Pomodoros it automatically prompts them to take a 15 or 30 minute break.  It also indicates the time at which the last Pomodoro, or break, ended so they can keep track of their timing in case they were not in front of their computer when the timer ended.  It gives the user the option to end the Pomodoro or break early in the event that it is not conducive to what they are doing, as well as providing a list of completed tasks that they can add to that allows them to see what they have accomplished.

## Conclusion

The Pomodoro Technique, and this app's use of it, is a great tool for increasing the userâ€™s focus on their tasks while decreasing the risk of burn out from the task itself.  It also reduces the feeling of being  overwhelmed by other distractions.  The regular breaks allow the user to increase productivity and avoid getting derailed.



[Try out the demo for yourself.](https://conkytom-pomodoro.herokuapp.com/)  The demo version has work sessions and break sessions that are only 5 seconds long just so you can test out the functionality of the Pomodoro sessions, and see that after 4 of them the user is allowed to take a 15 or 30 minute break.
