## Explanation

CSV-simplified is an open-source project that intends create an easy, user-friendly, graphical interface to view CSVs in a browser.  The application also intends to create useful tools to perform queries, search, and remove duplicates or anomalies on the provided CSV file.  The results can then viewed in the browser and saved in a new CSV.

## Problem

A CSV is very useful type of file, but it can use some help in becoming a more user-friendly, and readable format.  Large CSVs can be rather difficult to sift through, especially if the user knows there's a smaller range of values or entries that they are looking for.  Like any database, CSVs can have problems like duplicate entries or anomalous formatting errors.  Current tools that can perform these tasks often require a high degree of database knowledge, or an understanding of languages like SQL.  As useful and relatively compact as a CSV is, it could use some help in becoming more helpful

## Solution

CSV-simplified aims to create a app that would allow a user to upload a CSV file and is prompted about what they would like to do with it.  They can search the file for a specific value, or perform a query on it that will return a broader range of values that they need.  The text displayed is in a well organized and more readable format the CSV on its own.  The resulting table can be saved into new CSV file which can then in turn have a search or query performed on it.  For large CSVs this could easily cut out potentially hours of tedious searching, and copy/pasting to create a table with the desired information.  All of this can be done in a simple, streamlined user interface that anyone can use.  The user won't need an intimate knowledge about SQL or how databases work to scour their file for information, CSV-simplified does the work for them.

## Results

As of the writing of this article (Oct. 16, 2018) the open-source project is still ongoing, and in its early days.  At the moment CSV-simplified is only capable of reading and displaying a CSV file, but this is a huge step in the right direction for making these files more readable and accessible to people who are not familiar with programming languages.

## Conclusion

While CSV-simplified has yet to reach its full potential, it is a promising start to a powerful application suitable to experts and novices alike.
