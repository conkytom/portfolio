Brewright is by far my most ambitious project to date.  Building an interactive website with several databases that need to interact seamlessly, and transferring selections chosen or created in a modal onto the base page from scratch was quite a task. While the product I have posted is far from complete it is a fantastic framework for the larger program I hope to someday complete fully.

Currently I am working as a professional brewer and there are a lot of great, free online tools I use to help construct, predict, and calculate the necessary numbers for a brew, but I have yet to find one that has all of these things on a single page.  Most sites offer a pretty robust recipe formulator that allows me to add ingredients and see how this will affect the color, bitterness or alcohol of a beer, but they might not help me calculate the amount of water I need to mash in the beer or what temperature the water needs to be.

"Brewing" beer is a pretty broad term for several processes that need to happen to create sugar water and turn it into beer.  Many complicated calculations are necessary to predict the outcome of a given brew.  For example, hops are boiled during the brewing process, they impart bitterness and aroma in the beer.  The longer hops are boiled the more bitterness they can impart, while the less the are boiled the more aroma they impart.  Different hops have different amounts of bittering potential.  So already one can see that adding various kinds of hops at different times can require a lot of variables to predict the bitterness in the resulting beer.

I did not manage to get that far in the development of Brewright unfortunately.  However the user is able to create ingredients and apply important real world attributes to them, and then add those ingredients to a recipe.  The recipe borrows the ingredients from their database and applies it to its own.  Once this is done being able to calculate the all the potential outcome variables should be pretty easy.

Brewright's recipe page is intended to have all the tools necessary to add ingredients, customize their variables, and give an easy to read snapshot of what would be needed on brew day including a list of ingredients, when they should be added, how much water the brewer needs and at what temperature they will need it.  Should a brewer find that their resulting beer was noticeably different from what was predicted, the site should help them tweak the recipe's calculators to better reflect what happens on their brew system.  That way the next recipe they write should be more accurate in predicting the outcome.

As much as I love being a brewing nerd and gushing over these calculation details, I had started this project as part of an assignment and just did not have the time to put it together completely. I got caught up in how to properly structure the databases of the kinds of ingredients and the recipe itself so that it could work well together and be easy to understand on both the front and back end (granted having some brewing knowledge would give you a big leg up).  It also took me a while to get the styling and functionality of the modal pop-ups to look and work in a way that I felt was both minimalist and intuitive.
